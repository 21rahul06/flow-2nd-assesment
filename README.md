structFunc(): A public function defined within the struct, marked by "AREA 1".
Initialization
The struct is initialized in the contract's init() function, where all its variables are given default values.

SomeResource
This contract also defines a resource named SomeResource with a single publicly accessible variable e (Int) and a function resourceFunc() marked by "AREA 2". The resource is initialized with a default value in its init() function.

Public Functions
